# Xclass-Project
MAKE SURE THAT PYTHON IS INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER
https://www.python.org/downloads/

ALSO LEARN TO USE TERMINAL IN VSCODE TO RUN THE CODE

Project X backend and webapp

main.py used to run web application



### to set up
```
pip install flask
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install keyboard
pip install results
pip install RPi.GPIO        #only on raspberry pi
pip install python-crontab  #only on raspberry pi

```
IF ```pip``` doesnt work try using ```pip3``` instead

IF encountering permission related or errors add ```--user``` in the commands above, this helps us run commands as administrator

python main.py

Use the local server to open the web app. It should be in an IP form address.
